This is a mod for various strategy games, that makes province names change their name dynamically, to one that fits the culture of the faction that controls them.

In the common database [i](for all the supported games)[/i], there are currently [b]over 150.000[/b] names for [b]over 1.000[/b] languages, themes and time periods.

The names are meant to provide an immersive and authentic experience for the game's setting and time period.
However, if there are no names for a specific language for this context, names from other time periods, or even from very closely related languages, will be used instead, as long as they make sense and are a good fit.
