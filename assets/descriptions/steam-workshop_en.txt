This is a mod for various strategy games, that makes province names change their name dynamically, to one that fits the culture of the faction that controls them.

In the common database [i](for all the supported games)[/i], there are currently [b]over 180.000[/b] names for various languages, themes and time periods.

The names are meant to provide an immersive and authentic experience for the game's setting and time period.
However, if there are no names for a specific language for this context, names from other time periods, or even from very closely related languages, will be used instead, as long as they make sense and are a good fit.
